## With extra time I would have...

1. Added more styling to the table
2. Loading indicators for loading in the advocates, loading more
3. Add total count to api so I can hide the "Load More" when there isn't more to load
4. Debounce the search input so we're not hitting the api too much
5. Cache the search so we're not always hitting the API
6. Allow searching on the specialties
7. Unit tests
